# Naive Bayes Classification and Clustering
I built and trained a model to predict a label (either 0 or 1) based on 6 features for each data point using two methods: multinomial naive bayes and gaussian naive bayes. Then, I compared and evaluated the two models using macro F1 score and accuracy score.
