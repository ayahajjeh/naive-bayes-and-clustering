# Naive Bayes Classification and Clustering
In the first part of this project, I built and trained a model to predict a label (either 0 or 1) based on 6 features for each data point using two methods: multinomial naive bayes and gaussian naive bayes. Then, I compared and evaluated the two models using macro F1 score and accuracy score.
In the second part of this project, I implemented the K-means clustering algorithm supporting both random split initialization method and random seed selection method. To evaluate and compare models with different hyperparameters such as number of clusters, initialization method, and max number of iterations, I implemented from scrath a function that calculates the silhouette score of each final clustering model.
